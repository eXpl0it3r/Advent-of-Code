# Advent of Code 2021

Second time joining the programming puzzle solving during Advent.
I'm hoping this year won't have a deal breaker puzzle as last year.

**Note:** It's more fun to solve these puzzles yourself, so I highly recommend to do so, before checking my solutions.

Looking forward to discussing things on the [SFML Discord](https://discord.gg/nr4X7Fh) server again.
In case anyone wants to checkout some other solutions, here are links to some other repos.
